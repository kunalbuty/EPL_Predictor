# EPL Predictor
## Objective
In this project, I plan on creating a program that can predict the standings of the English premier league. Currently, I am still in the early stages, and have only implemented a skeleton for the code. Since most of the work has been data preparation, it is not currently available on GitHub. However, look in the documentation folder to find more information on the project
